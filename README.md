# Homework 1: EDA


# Dataset: [titanic](https://github.com/ga-students/DAT-NYC-30/blob/master/homework/hw1/titanic_dropna.csv)


# Data introduction video: [titanic sinking](https://youtu.be/9xoqXVjBEF8)


# Due: 1/11 (beginning of class)


# Format: ipython notebook submission on GitHub


## Instructions: answer the following questions with data and visuals

- What do you notice about the data? Any issues?
- What is the overall survival rate?
- What role does gender play in surviving?
- What role does class play in surviving?
- What role does age play in surviving?
- Given the above, do you have any guesses on what predicts survival?
- Do you have any ideas for new features we could create from the data that would help us predict if someone will survive?


## Note: only EDA is required! Doing any modeling is completely optional for this project.
